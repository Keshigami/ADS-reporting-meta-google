# Strategy: POAS vs. ROAS (The 2026 Shift)

**The Paradigm Shift:**
In 2024, agencies reported on **Revenue** (ROAS).
In 2026, agencies report on **Profit** (POAS).

Why? Because you can have "High ROAS" and still go bankrupt.

## 1. The Definitions

### ROAS (Return On Ad Spend)

* **Formula:** `Total Revenue / Ad Spend`
* **What it answers:** "For every $1 I put in the machine, how many dollars came out?"
* **The Flaw:** It ignores *margins*. If you sell a $100 product but it costs you $80 to make/fulfill, a 2.0 ROAS loses you money.

### POAS (Profit On Ad Spend)

* **Formula:** `(Total Revenue - Cost of Goods/Service) / Ad Spend`
* **Alternate Formula:** `Gross Profit / Ad Spend`
* **What it answers:** "For every $1 I put in the machine, how much *profit* did I keep?"
* **The Advantage:** It is the "True North" metric. If POAS > 1.0, you are profitable. Period.

## 2. The "ROAS Trap" (Example)

Imagine two campaigns for a Service Business (e.g., Electrician).

* **Service:** Panel Upgrade ($2,000 Revenue).
* **Cost to Fulfill (Parts + Labor):** $1,400.
* **Gross Profit:** $600.

| Metric | Campaign A (Broad Match) | Campaign B (High Intent) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ad Spend** | $1,000 | $1,000 |
| **Revenue** | $5,000 | $3,000 |
| **ROAS** | **5.0x (Looks Amazing)** | 3.0x (Looks Weak) |
| **Real Costs** | $3,500 (Parts/Labor) | $1,200 (Parts/Labor) |
| **Net Profit** | $500 | $800 |
| **POAS** | **0.5x (Barely Profitable)** | **0.8x (MORE Profitable)** |

**The Insight:**
Campaign A had a *higher* ROAS (5.0) but made *less* money ($500) because it attracted low-margin jobs or required more volume/overhead.
Campaign B had a *lower* ROAS (3.0) but made *more* profit ($800) because it was efficient.

**Conclusion:**
Automation and AI in 2026 optimizing for ROAS will chase Campaign A (Vanity).
Automation and AI in 2026 optimizing for POAS will chase Campaign B (Sanity).

## 3. How to Execute This

1. **Track Margins:** You must know the client's average margin (e.g., 40%).
2. **The New Benchmark:**
    * **ROAS Target:** 4.0x+ (Variable/Uncertain)
    * **POAS Target:** >1.0x (Break Even), >3.0x (Scaling)
