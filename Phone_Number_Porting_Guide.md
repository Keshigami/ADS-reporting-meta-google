## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Gather Client Information (5 minutes)

Send this message to the client:

```
Hi! To set up call tracking, we need to port your phone number to our system.

Please send me:
1. Your phone carrier (AT&T, Verizon, etc.)
2. Account number (on your phone bill)
3. Account PIN/passcode
4. Name exactly as it appears on the account
5. Service address on file

This lets us track all calls from your ads. Your number stays the same!
```

2. Click **"Port Number"**
3. Enter the phone number to port
4. Fill in carrier info from Step 1
5. Click **Next**

### Step 3: Letter of Authorization (5 minutes)

1. GHL generates a **Letter of Authorization (LOA)**
2. Download the LOA
3. Send to business owner to sign (digital signature OK)
4. Upload signed LOA back to GHL
5. Submit port request
